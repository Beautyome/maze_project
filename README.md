The Maze Project is a 3D game implemented in C++ using raycasting and SDL2

Embark on an immersive journey through dynamically rendered mazes, where you can rotate the camera, move through the environment, and encounter interactive elements. 

This project showcases the application of raycasting techniques, providing a foundation for creating maze-based games.
